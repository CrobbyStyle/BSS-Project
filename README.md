Project description:
BSS-Project is a system for the strategic allocation of break times in a work environment,
is an ubicuos, privacy preserving system that comprises of a hardware arrangement of sensors:
temperature, humidity, noise and voice level, those parameters are sent periodically through 
a wireless network to a web service, where the system, based on studied parameters and a
learning algorithm, decides when is time for a break, finally, the system, sends an alert to
mobile devices, in where is going to be installed an App that will be connected to the system
and listening in background to the web service.
